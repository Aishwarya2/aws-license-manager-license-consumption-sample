## AWS License Manager - Linux Subscriptions Python Sample Code

AWS License Manager provides you with the capability to view and manage commercial Linux subscriptions which you own and run on AWS. License utilization can be tracked across AWS Regions and accounts in AWS Organizations. Once data is discovered and aggregated, you will have insight to all your instances using commercial Linux subscriptions.

In addition, your discovered subscription data will be displayed in the License Manager console as Amazon CloudWatch dashboards. If your accounts are in Organizations, you can register a member account as the delegated administrator for administrative tasks. For more information, see Delegated administrators.

You track utilization across multiple subscriptions such as: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) subscription-included, RHEL Bring Your Own Subscription model (BYOS) with the Red Hat Cloud Access Program, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and Ubuntu Pro.
